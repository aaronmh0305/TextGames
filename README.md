# Word Scrambler

The Word Scrambler is a simple text-based game I made with c++. The user decides how many words (10-20) out of the 100 avaiable from the words.txt file, and he/she will randomly get a bunch of jumbled words that must be unscrambled. You can ask for a simple hint of what the word can possibly be.
